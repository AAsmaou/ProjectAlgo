# ProjectAlgo

Here we present the code that implements a solver for the coin change problem. 

--- HOW TO RUN ----- 

python SolverChangeProblem.py

A simple interface will appear for guiding you through the application. In particular, you will be asked to select the set of coins among four predefined sets. Then, you will have to insert the change and select the solver (the approach to use) by picking a choice among the 3 choices shown.
